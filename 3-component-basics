1/ import "component" from react library
if you are using classes (if you are using functions you don't need component)
import React { Component } from "react";

2/ create a class that extends "Component"

class <some_name> extends Component{

}

3/ you must (MUST) call the "render" method and return html code:
render(){
  return (
  //return some kind of html component ie'
  <h1>hi!</h1>
  )
}

4/ after the class, at the bottom of the file, export default <name of class>
it allows other components (index.js) to import it.
