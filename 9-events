1/ in html it would be "onclick" => all lower case
in jsx it is onClick => camel case
<button onClick={}></button>

2/ name the method so that it ends with "handler" so
that the user knows that it is a method for an event

switchNameHandler = ()=>{

}

3/ you MUST use "this" when calling the methods
<button onClick={this.switchNameHandler}></button>

4/ DONT add the parenthesis - it will run it right away
instead of waiting for a click
