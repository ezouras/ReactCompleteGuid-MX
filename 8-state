Managed from INSIDE the component
The magic about state is if it changes, it re-renders
the dom to reflect the change
it triggers a UI update

1/ unless you are using "hooks", you only manage states
within in class components. NOT functional components. HOWEVER,
you should use functional components as much as passible.
when using STATE you should do so with care. It can make your
app unpredictable esp as it grows.
