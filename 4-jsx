Use app.js in "one-app"
as a reference to the below

1 / when you render() { return (some html code) }
you are actually calling
render() { return React.createElement('div') }

2 / createElement method
takes three arguments
code be more but at least three
a / html element
b / configuration(styling)
c / any amount of children, can have more than one, they are separtaed
by comments.Depends how many children are in your class

to pass children, you need to call "React.createElement"
inside of the parent "React.createElement"
please see "App.js" in "one-app"

3 /
  for the 2n d argument, configuratnoi, of the createElement method, you can
pass { className: '<name of css class>' }

adding multiple children can get very messy, that 's why we use jsx
