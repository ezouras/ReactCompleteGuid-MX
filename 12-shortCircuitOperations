Short Circuit, in logical operations such as "OR", if the first operand is
true, js wont even look at the 2nd operand.  It "short circuits" it. because.. why not?

let person = {
  name:"Evie",
  age:50
}

console.log(person.job||"unemployed") //unemployed
since person.job is falsy, unemplyed is printed.
it will automatically go to the otherside, no matter what it is

1/ in an or operation, if the first side is false, it will ALWAYS print the right.
2/ in an OR operatnoi if the first side is true, it will always print the first side.

3/ using short circuit in React// Short circuit operator
const Counter = ({count}) => {
  return <div>
    {count && <h1>Count: {count}</h1>}
  </div>
}

a/ if count is true, use the right side of the && operand
b/ if the count is falsy (undefined), dont do anything
