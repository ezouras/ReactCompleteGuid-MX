write html-ish code in js files

1/class is a reserved name!!
 can't use the word "class".  you use it to define a js class.
instead you use the word "className"

2/you MUST wrap everything up in a SINGLE root component (like a div).
<div>
  <h1>hi</h2>
</div>

3/props.children is reserved!!
if your passing elements to child component thru props,
props.children is taken for passing data between the tags!!!

4/ state is a RESERVED word! (for state :)

5/ setState is a RESERVED method by the Component library
(why you need components instead of functions to set the state).
if you want the dom to react to your changes, you must use setState

6/ the "useState" method is defined by react when importing hooks.
unlike a components
"setState" IT DOES NOT MERGE - IT
REPLACES and so you MUST include everything otherwise, it will be
lost

7/ you can use ternary expressions but not "if" statements in a {} block
{
  this.state.showDiv?<div>HI!</div>:null;
}

YOU CANT DO THIS:
{ if(this.state.showDiv){
  <div>you will never see me :(</div>
}
