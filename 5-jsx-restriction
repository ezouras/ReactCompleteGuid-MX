write html-ish code in js files

1/class is a reserved name!!
 can't use the word "class".  you use it to define a js class.
instead you use the word "className"

2/you MUST wrap everything up in a SINGLE root component (like a div).
<div>
  <h1>hi</h2>
</div>

3/props.children is reserved!!
if your passing elements to child component thru props,
props.children is taken for passing data between the tags!!!

4/ state is a RESERVED word! (for state :)
